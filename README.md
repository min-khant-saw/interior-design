# React Js

## Components

# Navbar

The `Navbar` component is a React functional component that renders a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu icon that toggles a sidebar menu.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `Navbar` component:

`<Navbar />`

When rendered, this will display a navigation bar with a hamburger menu icon that toggles a sidebar menu. The sidebar menu includes links to Home, Shop, About Us, Contact us, Services, Blog, Login, and Sign Up pages.

## Sing in

This is a React functional component that handles the login functionality of a website. It uses the `useReducer`, `useState`, and `useMemo` hooks from React.

### Reducer, useState & useMemo

The component first defines a reducer function that takes in the current state and an action to perform on it. The initial state for the `login` object is defined with empty email and password fields using the `useReducer` hook.

The component also sets up state for toggling password visibility using the `useState` hook.

The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize a function that makes a GET request to the server to check if the user is already logged in, and if so, redirects them to the home page.

### SingIn function

The `signIn` function is defined to handle the login functionality. It first creates a new instance of the FormData object and adds the email and password to it. It then makes a POST request to the server with the FormData object as the payload. If the request is successful, the user is redirected to the home page.

The component returns a form with inputs for email and password, with icons and labels. The `onChange` event handler for the email input field calls the reducer function to update the email field in the `login` object. The password input field is a bit more complex, with an icon for toggling password visibility and logic for showing or hiding the password. The form also includes a submit button that calls the `signIn` function on submit.

## Register

This is a React component for a registration form that allows users to sign up for an account.

### useState, useMemo & useReducer

The component uses several React hooks, including `useReducer`, `useState`, and `useMemo`.

`useReducer` is used to manage state for the form inputs. The initial state is set with empty strings for the first name, last name, email, password, and password confirmation. The `reducer` function is used to update the state based on specific actions.

`useState` is used to manage state for any errors that occur during form submission. The initial state is set to an empty string.

`useMemo` is used to memoize a function that makes an HTTP request to the server to check if the user is already authenticated. The function is only re-evaluated if the value of the `localStorage.getItem("token")` changes.

### singUp function & jsx

The `singUp` function is defined to handle form submission. It prevents the default form submission behavior, creates a new instance of `FormData` to store the form data, adds the form data to the `FormData` object, and makes a POST request to register the user with the server. If there are any errors, the `setErr` function is called to update the error state variable.

The JSX code renders a form with input fields for the first name, last name, email, password, and password confirmation. The input fields are bound to the state variables using the `value` attribute and the `onChange` attribute is used to call the `setUser` function to update the state. When the form is submitted, the `singUp` function is called. If there are any errors, the `err` variable is displayed to the user.

## Main Component

This component is a functional component that displays a subscription form and an image preview.

### Props

-   `setSubscribelog`: A function to set the subscription log message.

### State

-   `error`: A string to hold an error message, if any.

-   `email`: A string to hold the email address entered by the user.

### Hooks

-   `useMemo`: This hook is used to perform a GET request when the token in local storage changes.

### Functions

-   `subscribe`: This function is called when the user submits the email subscription form. It appends the email to a `FormData` object and sends a POST request to the `/subscribe` endpoint with the form data.

### Rendered Output

The component returns a `div` element containing conditional rendering based on the `error` state. If the error is equal to `"Request failed with status code 401"`, it displays a message asking the user to sign up and a button to redirect the user to the registration page.

Below that, there is a `form` element containing an input field to capture the email address and a button to submit the email subscription. When the user submits the form, the `subscribe` function is called. Finally, there is an image preview displayed on the right side of the screen, which is hidden on smaller screens.

## LoginController

The `LoginController` class is responsible for handling the authentication process for users.

### Methods:

-   `__construct()` - Constructor for the `LoginController` class.

-   `login(Request $request)` - Authenticate a user and generate a token.

Both methods are described in detail below.

## Logout Controller

This PHP code defines a controller named `LogoutController` that handles user logout functionality in a web application. The code is defined in the `App\Http\Controllers\Auth` namespace.

## Methods

### \_\_construct()

The `__construct()` method is left empty intentionally, and it is used to instantiate the `LogoutController` class.

### logout()

The `logout()` method handles the user logout functionality. It takes an instance of the `Request` class as an argument, which represents the incoming HTTP request.

The method first uses the `Auth` facade to get the currently authenticated user and deletes their current access token by calling the `currentAccessToken()` method and then the `delete()` method on it.

# Subscribe Mail

This is a Laravel mailable class for sending subscription confirmation emails.

## Methods

### `envelope()`

This method returns an Envelope instance, which represents the message envelope. It contains information about the email's recipient, sender, subject, etc.

### `content()`

This method returns a Content instance, which represents the message content. In this case, it's a markdown template that will be used to render the email's body.

### `attachments()`

This method returns an array of Attachment instances. Attachments can be files or other resources that are attached to the email message. In this case, there are no attachments, so an empty array is returned.

# Subscribe Controller

This is a Laravel controller for handling subscription requests.

## Methods

### `__construct()`

This is the constructor for the `SubscribeController` class. In this case, it's empty because there's no initialization code that needs to be run.

### `subscribe(Request $request)`

This method handles the "subscribe" endpoint. It accepts a POST request with an "email" parameter, validates it, creates a new "subscribe" record in the database, and then dispatches a job to send a confirmation email to the subscriber.

The method contains the following steps:

1.  Validate the request input data. It should contain an "email" parameter that is a string with a maximum length of 255 characters, and it should not already exist in the "subscribes" table.
2.  If the input data is valid, create a new "subscribe" record in the database using the "Subscrebe" model, which represents the "subscribes" table in the database.
3.  Dispatch a new job to send a confirmation email to the subscriber using the "SubscribeJob" class. The job takes the subscriber's email as its only parameter.
4.  Return a JSON response indicating that the request was successful.
