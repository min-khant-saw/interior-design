# Logout Controller

This PHP code defines a controller named `LogoutController` that handles user logout functionality in a web application. The code is defined in the `App\Http\Controllers\Auth` namespace.

## Methods

### \_\_construct()

The `__construct()` method is left empty intentionally, and it is used to instantiate the `LogoutController` class.

### logout()

The `logout()` method handles the user logout functionality. It takes an instance of the `Request` class as an argument, which represents the incoming HTTP request.

The method first uses the `Auth` facade to get the currently authenticated user and deletes their current access token by calling the `currentAccessToken()` method and then the `delete()` method on it.
